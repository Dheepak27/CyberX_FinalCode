# CyberX_FinalCode
Project submitted in CyberX hackathon final held in VIT-Chennai


This is the code we as a team of three submitted in the Final round of CyberX hackathon. We were given 5 problem statements to work on and we chose the problem of Anomaly Detection. We basically encountered this tasks with the help of OpenCV and other computer vision modules in python.This code basically works to detect different anomalies such as:
*New face recognition
*Gun detection at night
*Theft detection at night
*Vehicle overspeeding at night
When any one of anomaly is detected a notification is sent to a concerned authority.
